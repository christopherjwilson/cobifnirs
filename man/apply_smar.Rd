\title{Apply Motion Artifact Correction (Despike & Interpolate)}
\usage{
apply_smar(nirsData, iqr_multiplier = 1.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{nirsData}{(dataframe) NIRS data imported via import_nirs().}

\item{iqr_multiplier}{(numeric) How many Interquartile Ranges (IQR) above the norm counts as a spike?
Default is 1.5 (standard statistical outlier definition). Higher = less sensitive.}
}
\value{
Dataframe with artifacts removed and interpolated.
}
\description{
Identifies motion artifacts (spikes) based on the rate of change
relative to the signal's standard deviation (or IQR). It replaces these spikes
with linear interpolation, preserving the signal timing without aggressive smoothing.
